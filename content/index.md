I'm Carlos, a Swiss [photographer](http://www.faustkeil.ch) fascinated by data and its visualizations, currently learning how to code.

My roadmap is simple: right now, I'm focusing on the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and an introductory Python course. My goal is to apply these core concepts to build data visualizations and simple web apps.

This digital garden is my _refugio_, a peaceful hideout where ideas and thoughts can quietly grow, far from the noise of everyday life. It’s inspired by the [_hórreos_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B3rreo), traditional storage houses from northern Spain, mainly found in Asturias and Galicia. These small huts are built on stone pillars to protect their contents from rising damp and unwanted pests.

I am a strong believer in [_Shoshin_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin), a concept from Zen Buddhism that means "beginner's mind." It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and freedom from preconceptions when learning, even at an advanced level, just as a beginner would.

My message is simple: Anyone can learn anything if they dedicate their time and mind to it.
